# SUBSCRIPTION FIX - WEBHOOK EVENTS TABLE
# ==========================================
# 
# PROBLEM: Stripe webhooks are failing because the stripe_webhook_events table does not exist.
# This causes subscription status updates to fail after payment.
#
# SOLUTION: Run the SQL in WEBHOOK_FIX.sql in your Supabase SQL Editor
#
# STEPS:
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gqalsczfephexbserzqp/sql/new
# 2. Copy the entire contents of WEBHOOK_FIX.sql
# 3. Paste into the SQL editor
# 4. Click "Run" to execute
# 5. Verify the table was created by running: SELECT * FROM stripe_webhook_events LIMIT 1;
# 6. Test the subscription flow again
#
# After this fix, webhooks should work and subscriptions will be properly updated.
